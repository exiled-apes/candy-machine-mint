# Introduction

The **Candy-Machine-V2-Responsive-UI** project is a fork of the famous [Candy-Machine-Mint](https://github.com/exiled-apes/candy-machine-mint) upgraded to the recent **Candy Machine V2** Solana release.
But that's not all, I share with you a **Prod-ready Responsive UI** which can be easily customized in 5mn.

I did this in a few hours, and didn't have the time to make it fully ReactJs best practices compliant. So please be kind :)

For instructions on how to set up a V2 candy machine, please refer to Metaplex's documentation [here](https://docs.metaplex.com/candy-machine-v2/Introduction)

## About Forked Candy-Machine-Mint

The [Candy-Machine-Mint](https://github.com/exiled-apes/candy-machine-mint) project is designed to let users fork, customize, and deploy their own candy machine mint app to a custom domain, ultra fast.

A candy machine is an on-chain Solana program (or smart contract) for managing fair mint. Fair mints:
* Start and finish at the same time for everyone.
* Won't accept your funds if they're out of NFTs to sell.

The Candy-Machine-Mint project is meant to be as simple and usable as possible, accessible to everyone from long-time crypto devs to junior React devs with a vague interest in NFTs. Our goal is to empower users to create their own front ends to display, sell, and manage their NFTs as simply as possible by just updating a few styled components and following a well-documented process for setup and shipping.

## Getting Set Up

### Prerequisites

* Download a Code Editor such as Visual Studio Code.

* Ensure you have recent versions of both `node` and `yarn` installed.

* Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) to install the Solana Command Line Toolkit.

* Follow the instructions [here](https://hackmd.io/@levicook/HJcDneEWF) to install the Metaplex Command Line Utility.
  * Installing the Command Line Package is currently an advanced task that will be simplified eventually.

### Installation

#### 1. Fork the project & clone it. Example:

```
git clone https://github.com/Fulgurus/candy-machine-v2-responsive-ui.git
```

#### 2. Define your environment variables (.env file)

Rename the `.env.example` file at the root directory to `.env` and update the following variables in the `.env` file:

```
REACT_APP_CANDY_MACHINE_ID=__PLACEHOLDER__
```
set __PLACEHOLDER__ with the candy machine pubkey you get once you upload & create your candy machine in Metaplex project. You can find back the value from the `.cache/temp.json` file of your Metaplex project. This file is created when you run the `ts-node candy-machine-v2-cli.ts upload ...` command.

```
REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
```

This identifies the Solana network you want to connect to. Options are `devnet`, `testnet`, and `mainnet`.

```
REACT_APP_SOLANA_RPC_HOST=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

This identifies the RPC server your web app will access the Solana network through.

#### 3. Build the project and test. Go to the root project directory and type the commands :

To install dependencies :

```
yarn install
```

To test the app locally in the development mode (localhost:3000) :

```
yarn start
```

To build the production package (generated in build folder of the project) :

```
yarn build
```

#### 4. Customize the website UI :

##### 4.1 `App.css` : update 5 main CSS variables with your custom colors :

```
:root {
  --main-background-color: #343A50;
  --card-background-color: #51576D;
  --card-background-lighter-color: #7A7F92;
  --main-text-color:#F7F6F4;
  --title-text-color:#3CBA8B;
}
```

##### 4.2 `public` folder :

- Update existing demo cool cats images (cool-cats.gif, logo.png) with your owns images in project `public` folder. Make sure to name them identically.
- Add your custom website title in `index.html` : `<title>Mint Page</title>`

##### 4.3 `Home.tsx` :

Scroll down down to line 380 (`return <main> [...]`) and start to update all titles/menu/text/images/text... as wished in the whole React HTML block.

That's it ! Enjoy your beautiful candy machine :)

##  Available Commands Recap :

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
